# 🚀 ReferralFlow — A Personalized Referral Outreach Widget

**Built by Aditi Sahu for the alfred_ Founding Intern Challenge**  
Challenge: “Build a widget for 1 customer that transforms their workflow.”

---

## 🎯 Target Customer

**Customer Archetype:**  
Early-career professionals (students, recent grads, career switchers) targeting competitive tech roles — actively reaching out for referrals on LinkedIn.

**Their Workflow:**  
- Scanning job boards and saving links
- Searching for employees at target companies
- Sending 10–15 connection requests per day
- Tracking referral status manually or in their head
- Forgetting to follow up or personalize messages
- Copy-pasting the same message again and again

**Information They Rely On:**  
- Who they’ve contacted and when  
- Who accepted the request  
- What message they sent  
- Whether someone agreed to refer them  
- What job they’re asking about  

**Repetitive Tasks That Slow Them Down:**  
- Typing the same referral message multiple times  
- Forgetting who replied and who didn’t  
- Digging through DMs to find conversations  
- Switching between tabs, sheets, and drafts  

**Tools They Currently Cobble Together:**  
- Google Sheets or Excel  
- Notion or Airtable  
- LinkedIn DMs  
- Email drafts  
- Calendar reminders

## 📉 What Alternatives Exist Today — and Why They Fall Short

### 1. **Google Sheets / Excel**

**Why it falls short:**
- ❌ No visual stages or flow  
- ❌ No message guidance or template storage  
- ❌ Easy to forget who to follow up with  
- ❌ Emotionally cold — feels like admin work  
- ❌ Not optimized for mobile  

ReferralFlow brings warmth, workflow, and structure — not just data entry.

---

### 2. **Notion / Airtable**

**Why it falls short:**
- ❌ Requires manual setup  
- ❌ No referral-specific logic or reminders  
- ❌ Flexible, but not focused  

ReferralFlow is **opinionated** — designed specifically for job referral outreach.

---

### 3. **Job Tracker Tools (Huntr, Teal, etc.)**

**Why it falls short:**
- ❌ Built for applications, not referrals  
- ❌ No contact-stage logic  
- ❌ Doesn’t track conversations, messages, or outreach history  

ReferralFlow helps you *get the referral*, not just log an application.

---

### 4. **LinkedIn DMs and Notes**

**Why it falls short:**
- ❌ No filtering or reminders  
- ❌ Conversations buried in inbox  
- ❌ Zero structure or visibility  

ReferralFlow is built for clarity and next steps.
